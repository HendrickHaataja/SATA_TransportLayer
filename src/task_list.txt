Problems to deal with:

all files:
1. conform to coding standards

rate_match_blk:
1. clear and reset should be separate signals
2. should we do show ahead or normal?
3. more logic around empty/not empty, map datak and data to ALIGNp when tx_empty, rx_full
4. add flag for when rate match block is transmitting invalid data
5. Glitch in check for rx/tx_readreq and readreqprev---.... one clock of invalid

phy init main blk:
1. do we need to act on phy clear status? why is this included in the signal
2. remove combinational logic...
